## Moe Driven Development?

```
Moe(萌え) sometimes romanized as moé, is a Japanese word that refers to 
feelings of strong affection mainly towards characters in anime, manga, 
video games, and other media directed at the otaku market.

- Wikipedia, "Moe (slang)"
```

This project is strongly inspired by hiyohiyo, the developer of CrystalDiskInfo and CrystalDiskMark, and his slides "[Programming Win32 from the Second Generation MDD](https://www.slideshare.net/hiyohiyo/mddwin32)". Developing software with cute characters is considered to give positive feedbacks to developers, so I decided to do this as the first project, which is driven by MDD.
